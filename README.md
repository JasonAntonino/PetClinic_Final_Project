# Project Overview
For our project we were given a working CRUD application that had a separate Frontend and backend. 
It is our job to make it have a separate database to essentially transform it into a 3 tiered architecture.

- [ ] Frontend (makes HTTP requests to the backend, that his front end gets its contents.) Angular a Typescript version of flask.
- [ ] Backend (API, just returns information,no HTML attached)  Spring boot, (Java version of flask)
- [ ] Database
- [ ] 
We needed to containerise the frontend and the backend within Docker , successfully allowing the backend to interact with the database.


Taking an application, putting it into a container, and it still work inside the container.


The frontend and backend application are both in languages we are not yet accustomed to. The frontend was an Angular application in typescript and the backend was a spring boot application in Java. We were required to deploy the application or in simpler terms making the application available via the internet. As a group we had to decided which tools would be best suited to our project. We eventually decided on XYZ. The reasoning for these choices is as follows.


Docker swarm


We were expected and required to hold daily stand ups.

# Architecture 

We decided on using the following tools and technologies to complete the deployment:

* [Terraform](http://terraform.io)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)
* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)

# Cost

Our cost varied a great deal, this was because we went from using Docker Swarm to using EKS.
Originally we were projected to spend Â£7.28 a day with full deployment.
However, once we switched to using Kubernetes our projected cost estimates were < ADDHERE >

## Areas of improvement

* Using Kubernetes would have allowed for further functionality than Docker Swarm. 
    However, because it requires separate installations of various cli tools and having to have high level all of them, given more time and improved understanding this may have been a better tool to implement.
* Using Jira instead of Trello to better organise tasks and create burndown charts.
* A general better understanding of the tools.

## Acknowledgements
* We would like to acknowledge our tutors at QA for their teaching of technologies necessary to complete this task. 
* We would also like to thank our team, without our combined cooperation this would not have been possible.
